    content: "The Illustrated Compendium of Amazing Animal Facts by Maja Safstrom, contains many interesting facts about animals, from reptiles to birds, amphibians to mammals, bugs and more! In the beginning of the book, you will find a list of page numbers with a different animal on each. Each animal has 2 pages dedicated to it with little unknown facts to read on. I will share with you a few of those interesting facts that I learned: Crocodiles actually cry tears when they eat, an octopus has more brain cells than a human, a frog has jumped more than 45 feet at in one jump, and even though a Panda's diet consists of 99% Bamboo, their stomachs were actually designed to eat meat! Those are just a few of the fun facts this book contains. The design of each animal is well drawn out looking adorable as ever. This is a great book for children and adults. You get to see the fun illustrations, and learn about facts you may have never known about before. My son loves this book and we find it very useful for research days in homeschooling."
